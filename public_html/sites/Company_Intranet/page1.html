                    <h2>The Ritual</h2>
                    <p>
                        For the newcommers, this is for you. As you know, we serve 
                        the <b>Ancient Ones</b>. And they require us once a year to sacrifice
                        youthful beings. Our <b>Organization</b> is located all around the world,
                        and our purpose is to perform the Ritual in order to satisfy the Ancient Ones.

                    <h2>The Ancient Ones</h2>
                    <p>
                        (DISCLAIMER: This is not an image of the Ancient Ones) If you still don't understand what we do, or why we do it, this will surely
                        help. The Ancient Ones were beings who roamed the Earth long before humanity began. When humanity did begin, they decided it would be "entertaining" to allow
                        us to continue to exist. And so they decided to sleep under the Earth, and accept the blood of our sacrifices to stay in their slumber. IF WE FAIL TO COMPLETE THE RITUAL, THEY WILL WAKE AND DESTROY US. So make sure that doesn't happen.

                    <h2>The Organization</h2>
                    <p>
                        We have locations all over the world, and as mentioned above, our purpose is to keep the Ancient Ones happy. How we do that is by successfully performing the Ritual. As long as we succeed once, the Ancient Ones will be satisfied. Therefore, to better our chances, we perform the Ritual simultaneously around the world.
